# Calendar

A modern calendar application built with React Native and Expo. Currently works completely offline with plans to become an online calendar with end-to-end encryption.

## What it is

A clean calendar app that lets you manage events and calendars across mobile and web platforms. Built with TypeScript and React Native for a consistent experience everywhere.

## What it does

- **Multiple views**: Switch between day, week, and month views
- **Event management**: Create, edit, and delete events with descriptions and locations
- **Multiple calendars**: Organize events with color-coded calendars
- **Offline-first**: Works completely without internet connection
- **Cross-platform**: Runs on iOS, Android, and web

## The plan

Building toward an **online calendar with end-to-end encryption (E2EE)**. The current offline-first architecture is designed to seamlessly integrate with encrypted cloud sync, ensuring your calendar data remains private and secure while being accessible across all your devices.

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Then open the app on your preferred platform:
- **Web**: `npm run web`
- **iOS**: `npm run ios`
